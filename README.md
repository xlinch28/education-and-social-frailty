Prevalence of social frailty status and its educational gradients among middle-aged and older adults across six aging cohorts
Using harmonized, population-based datasets from six major longitudinal aging studies across the United States, England, Europe, South Korea, Mexico, and China, this project estimates the cross-context prevalence of social frailty and examines its association with educational attainment.

## Key Findings (Summary)
Social pre-frailty ranged from 54.03% (U.S.) to 74.11% (South Korea).
Social frailty ranged from 5.85% (Mexico) to 14.36% (Europe).
A consistent educational gradient was observed in all countries except South Korea.
Substantial between-country heterogeneity was detected.
